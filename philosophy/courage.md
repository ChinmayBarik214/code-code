- When emotions are shutdown and one has enough self-control to be unaffected by praise, rebuke or noise.
- One finds that the differentiation of all life actions, however simple, complex, easy or excruciating
- Takes the same amount of ability, the same amount of courage.

- One persistently chooses not to be great, with just as much effort as one who consistently chooses to be great.
- One has to put in just as much effort to pull an all-nighter than as required to get a good nights sleep.
- Most people are men.
- We are not men.

- The responsibility is far greater.
- And we must be better than the ones who came before us.
- They left all this, so we could be better.
- Better than them.
> You must be better than me,
> Understand.

> “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”

## May our actions be High Yield, always.
